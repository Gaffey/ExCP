## Updates
* **2024/06/14**: Training and compressing codes of Pythia-410M are released [here](https://github.com/Gaffey/ExCP).

## Overview
We propose a novel Extreme Checkpoint Compression (ExCP) framework, which significantly reduces the required storage of training checkpoints while achieving nearly lossless performance. We first calculate the residuals of adjacent checkpoints to obtain the essential but sparse information for higher compression ratio. To further excavate the redundancy parameters in checkpoints, we then propose a weight-momentum joint shrinking method to utilize another important information during the model optimization, i.e., momentum. In particular, we exploit the information of both model and optimizer to discard as many parameters as possible while preserving critical information to ensure optimal performance. Furthermore, we utilize non-uniform quantization to further compress the storage of checkpoints.

## Requirements
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Training and Compression

1. Pick corresponding data from [PILE](https://the-eye.eu/public/AI/pile/) dataset according to the lists in `./datalist`, and save the data at `[pos1]/[pos2]`.

```
python generate_subdataset.py --pile_path [PILE] --datalist ./datalist/datalist1.txt --save_path [pos1]
python generate_subdataset.py --pile_path [PILE] --datalist ./datalist/datalist2.txt --save_path [pos2]
```

2. Run the scripts.

```
bash scripts/pretrain_phase1.sh [pos1]
bash scripts/pretrain_phase2.sh [pos2]
```

If you use the cached data, please uncomment the `--data_cache_dir` and `--read_cached` option.

3. If you want to evaluate the model, you may use [open-compass](https://github.com/open-compass/opencompass).

### Eval checkpoints

Our compressed checkpoints will be released soon. For convenience, we provide the full checkpoint of the first saved iteration (checkpoint-1000), so the total compressed file is larger than theoretical.

Download the checkpoints and run the scripts to reconstruct all checkpoints saved in the training process.

```
bash scripts/recon_ckpts.sh
```
